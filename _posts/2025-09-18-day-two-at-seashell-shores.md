Today is the second day that Seashell Shores is open.  I started my day off on a dolphin watch boat tour.  We saw so many dolphins, fish, seaturtles, as well as even sharks!  After the boat tour I went headed to the Sand Bar and Grill where I had a fish sandwich and fries.  To end my time at Seashell Shores Spa and Resort I to the spa for a nice relaxing massage before heading back home.
