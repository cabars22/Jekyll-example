Today was Seashell Shores first day being open!  There were many guests that came and joined in on the first day of fun on opening day.  It was a lovely sunny day and couldnt have been better for guests to enjoy all the thing that Seashell Shores Spa and Resort has to offer such as the beach, playing volleyball, going on boat tours, having a spa day, and enjoying the dining options.

Today I got to Seashell Shores Spa and Resort in the afternoon and started off at the beach enjoying being out in the sun.  Once I started to heat up in the sun I went swimming in the ocean.  Once I cooled off in the ocean I headed to dinner at Sand Bar and Grill where I had a delicious burger to end my night off with.
